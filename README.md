## **Abstract**  
Text-generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with the introduction of large language models (LLMs). However, Electroencephalography (EEG)-based text production remains a challenge due to high data and computational requirements. This paper presents a novel approach combining the **Gemma 2B LLM** with a **classifier-LLM architecture** and an **RNN encoder**, significantly reducing data and compute demands while achieving performance improvements of **10%** over existing methods.  

Our approach demonstrates efficient **transfer learning** for EEG-based text production, offering a **robust and functional** system even under data constraints. The integration of **EEG decoding with LLMs** has the potential to advance assistive technologies, enabling greater independence and communication for individuals with severe motor limitations.
